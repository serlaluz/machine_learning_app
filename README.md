## Mobile App To Determine Survivability on Titanic using *RandomForestClassifier*

This is a demonstration on how to build a mobile app based ML model. I've changed the classifier model to RandomForestClassifier.

I've used Google Collab notebook for the script and MIT App Inventor interface to build the prototype. On this repo, I've uploaded the following files

1. Titanic_Mobile_App.ipynb [Google Collab Notebook]
2. titanic.csv [Training/Testing Set]
3. titanic_mobile_app.aia [Used as a protoype for MIT APP Invent]
4. titanic_mobile_app.py [python script, can use the notebook above]

For more information, please check out the webinar that gives you a detail step by step process on how to build.
